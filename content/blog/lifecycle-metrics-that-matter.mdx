## Diagnose the journey first

Lifecycle metrics only make sense in context. Start with a journey map that highlights key activation, engagement, and expansion moments. From there, define metrics that reflect healthy progression.

## Track depth, not just breadth

Surface-level engagement (opens, clicks) tells part of the story. Layer in signals like:

- **Time-to-value** for onboarding experiences
- **Feature adoption** for activation campaigns
- **Repeat purchase rate** for ecommerce sequences

## Create actionable dashboards

Great dashboards answer "What should we do next?" Combine trend lines with segment filters, cohort tables, and alerts when KPIs drift. Give stakeholders a single workspace they can trust.

## Close the loop with experimentation

Lifecycle marketing thrives on iteration. Document hypotheses, run controlled tests, and socialize learnings. Over time, you''ll build a library of playbooks that accelerate performance.
