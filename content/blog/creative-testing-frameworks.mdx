## Clarify your hypotheses

Start every test with a clear hypothesis tied to the behavior you want to influence. Are you testing a new value prop, format, or motion style? Document it and align the team.

## Tier your testing roadmap

Prioritize tests across three levels:

1. **Foundational**: Validate messaging pillars, proof points, and design systems.
2. **Optimization**: Test variations on winning concepts-headlines, CTAs, framing.
3. **Horizon**: Explore bold ideas and emerging formats to uncover new winners.

## Operationalize feedback loops

Collect qualitative and quantitative inputs. Use comment tagging, post-click analytics, and creative-specific dashboards. Celebrate wins, but more importantly, codify learnings for future briefs.

## Roll insights across channels

Great insights shouldn''t stay siloed. Package learnings for lifecycle, content, and product teams so every customer touchpoint benefits.
