## Lifecycle blueprint

We start with a comprehensive audit to uncover gaps in onboarding, nurture, and expansion flows. Our team then designs messaging, builds automations, and configures reporting. Expect iterative testing on copy, creative, and cadence to boost engagement and revenue metrics.

## Sample workflows

- Lead nurture sequences tied to content and offers
- Onboarding journeys triggered by product milestones
- Win-back and reactivation campaigns with incentives
- Expansion playbooks for cross-sell and upsell motions
